/*
    The Sysprogs fork of OpenOCD uses an ELF file providing the functions below to automaticaly program external FLASH memories.
    The usual use scenario is shown below:
        1. OpenOCD makes a backup of the RAM area needed by the image and loads the image
        2. OpenOCD calls the entry point and waits until the image calls FLASHPlugin_InitDone()
        3. OpenOCD calls FLASHPlugin_Probe() and FLASHPlugin_FindWorkArea() to query general information about the FLASH bank
        4. OpenOCD calls FLASHPlugin_Unload() and then restores the RAM area occupied by the image and the work area.
        
    When gdb requests OpenOCD to write the FLASH memory, the following happens:
        1. The plugin is loaded into the target again
        2. OpenOCD calls FLASHPlugin_EraseSectors()
        3. OpenOCD calls FLASHPlugin_ProgramAsync(). If it's not implemented, it calls FLASHPlugin_ProgramSync() several times instead.
        
    The FLASH plugin should be linked using the RAM version of the linker script for your device. OpenOCD will then automatically load
    the plugin into RAM, let it do the programming and restore the original RAM contents.
